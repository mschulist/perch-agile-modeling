This database will hold information about the project, such as target recordings and classifiers. 

The embeddings, recordings, and annotations are in a separate hoplite database. As of now, we will only allow for a single hoplite database per project (and therefore a single embedding model per project), but this restriction will be lifted in the future to allow for comparing embedding models.
