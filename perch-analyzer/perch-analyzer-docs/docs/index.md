# Welcome!

Welcome to the Perch Analyzer documentation.

## Overview

Perch Analyzer is a tool for analyzing bird sounds using machine learning. We use _agile learning_[^1] to build a high quality bird vocalization classifier, mixing CLI and visual components to aid in this process.


## Installation

To get started with Perch Analyzer, install it using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). We highly recommend uv due to its speed and correctness guarantees.

*TODO: once we get this finished!*
