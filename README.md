# Perch Agile Modeling

# Goal

The goal of this project is to be able to classify large batches of ARU recordings using transfer learning. The [Perch framework](https://github.com/google-research/perch-hoplite) is an incredible took for bird vocalization classifiation and works very well due to the fact that the final training is done on the same recordings that you want to classify. 

# Perch Analyzer

In a spin-off from BirdNet Analyzer, we reimplement many of the same features BirdNet Analyzer has to offer, with a stronger focus on the agile modeling workflow. See the documentation below to see how to get started.
